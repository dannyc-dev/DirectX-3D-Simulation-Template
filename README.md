### DirectX 11 3D Simulation Template

3D simulation template utilizing [DirectXTK](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXTK). I put this together as a starting point for a few of my 3D simulation projects that utilize Microsoft's DirectX Toolkit Library. Some cool projects I've put together utilizing this template and the toolkit library:
